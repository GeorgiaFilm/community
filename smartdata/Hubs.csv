Curiosity Lab at Peachtree Corners is a publicly funded living lab designed to provide a real world test environment to advance next generation intelligent mobility and smart city technology. Assets include a 1.5 mile autonomous vehicle test track located within a commercial office park, fully operational 5G, 1G of dedicated fiber, DSRC units, video surveillance, smart poles and a 25,000 square foot technology incubator."
LaGrange Intelligent Highway,The Ray Highway,LaGrange,GA,30004,USA,32.8771,-85.1505,,,,https://www.theray.org,The Ray (Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Vehicles),"An 18 mile stretch of interstate that serves as a proving ground for emerging technologies. A P4 partnership between GDOT, 3M and The Ray resulted in physical infrastructure along the road for machine vision systems and wayfinding. A cost sharing partnership between GDOT, Panasonic and The Ray resulted in the connected, digital environment for V2X. This corridor is serving as a living laboratory for the active traffic management of interstate lanes, and enables real world testing of advanced mobility/modalities, such as platooning and autonomous driving."
