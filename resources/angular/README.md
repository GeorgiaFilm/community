# Angular  

The following documents how to deploy an npm library using Angular.  
In Progress: combining a member list view with the HERE Location API.  

First, confirm you have Angular CLI installed on your local machine.  

<code>ng --version</code>

If the command above returns "command not found", update npm and node. Mac users may find that updating via Brew does not associate the ng command. Instead, use [the npm and node installer](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).  Then run:  

<code>npm install -g @angular/cli</code>  

The following steps were prepared using Angular 8. 
Check for version changes in the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/)  


## Angular Module 
<!--
[Angular 6 - Create a module that can be installed with NPM](https://www.competa.com/blog/angular-6-create-a-module-that-can-be-installed-with-npm/)  
-->
Based on [Angular.io Creating Libraries](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries)

Create a new project:  

<code>ng new avatar1
cd avatar1
ng serve
</code>

Choose: Would you like to add Angular routing? y  
Which stylesheet format would you like to use? SCSS  

Open [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)  

To serve at another port:  ng serve --port 8080  
Also:Â --host 0.0.0.0 

At this point you'll need to open a new termininal window since the initial one is dedicated to serving the site.  

**Create a library within your project:**  
   
You can replace "modelearth" with your unique npm username.  

<code>ng generate library @modelearth/officemap</code>

--watch is included for faster incremental (partial) builds which emit amended files.  

Note: Your app can not use your library before you build it.
<!--
If upgrading, since already the default.
	Add the following in your tsconfig.lib.json for the --watch command.

<code>"angularCompilerOptions": {
    "enableResourceInlining": true,
}</code>
-->

<code>ng build @modelearth/officemap --watch
ng test @modelearth/officemap
ng lint @modelearth/officemap
</code>

The Angular test uses Karma with Jasmine.  (Cypress is used for the Hero app test below.)

The public API for your library is maintained in the public-api.ts file in your library folder.  


While working on a published library, you can use npm link to avoid reinstalling the library on every build.  

<!-- ng build did not completing with this on work computer...  -->

<!--
Skip next 2. May not apply to Angular 8: Add to projects/@modelearth/officemap/src/lib/@modelearth/officemap.module.ts  
(Need to confirm adding these next two lines are needed.)
<code>import { @modelearth/officemapModule } from '@modelearth/officemap';</code>

And in the imports array in the same .ts file:  
<code>imports: [@modelearth/officemapModule]</code>
-->


<!--
--prod flag Not used anymore for library builds since Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compiler is automatically applied.
https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler

Build for production:  

<code>ng build @modelearth/officemap --prod</code>
-->



Publish to npm:  

<code>cd dist/modelearth/officemap 
npm login
npm publish --access=public
</code>


After a few minutes, your package will appear in your list of packages: [https://www.npmjs.com/~modelearth](https://www.npmjs.com/~modelearth)  


## Heros App

We'll be adding a map to John Papa's Angular Hero app, which provides an opportunity to compare Angular with Vue and React, and includes Cypress for testing.  

[heroes-angular](https://github.com/johnpapa/heroes-angular)

<code>npm install</code>

Launch the app on port 4200:  

```
npm run quick
```

You'll need to close your existing server if it's running on port 4200.  
Neither of these commands assigned to a different port:  
npm run quick -p 4227  
ng serve --port 4227 (Frontend loads, but not json backend.)  

The next two commands may be needed if your edits disappear after hitting refresh.     

<code>npm update
npm audit fix</code>

<!--
No effect:
Ran npm update again since this error remained: Browserslist: caniuse-lite is outdated. Please run next command `npm update`
-->

Open Cypress to run tests:  

<code>npm run cypress</code>

Same as running: node_modules/.bin/cypress open  


## HERE Location Data

Next we'll [Render and Interact with HERE Location Data using Leaflet and Angular](https://developer.here.com/blog/render-and-interact-with-here-location-data-using-leaflet-and-angular)  

Create a new Angular project.  

```
ng new leaflet-project
```

Add a component.  See link above for additional html.  

```
ng g component here-map
```

here-map.component.html includes a #map attribute as our reference so we can access the DOM element from our TypeScript code.


In here-map.component.ts, we set ViewChild to reference our #map attribute from the HTML.
