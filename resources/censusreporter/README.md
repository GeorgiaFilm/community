# Enable Virtual Environment (Mac)

You may need to add (edit) a .zshrc file to load settings in a .bash_profile

Steps for installing pip on Mac. (Pip is the Python package installer.)

https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/

Use the system pip to bootstrap a user installation of pip:

> python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip

> python3 -m pip install --user virtualenvwrapper

> python3 -m venv env

> python3 -m pip install add2virtualenv


censusreporter instructions assume you're using virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper 
https://github.com/censusreporter/censusreporter

Might skip on new mac: virtualenv
venv (for Python 3) and virtualenv (for Python 2)

Might SKIP THESE if you are using Python3:
>> mkvirtualenv census --no-site-packages
>> workon census


If you are planning to use python 3 install the related python 3 versions.
(But since 2020 macs run Python 2.7, maybe only install in your virtual environ - if that is possible)

Ran "python3 -m pip install --user virtualenvwrapper"
pip install virtualenvwrapper



Ran these but don't again. Still could not access add2virtualenv:
sudo pip3 install virtualenv
sudo pip3 install virtualenvwrapper

Source with more:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13855463/bash-mkvirtualenv-command-not-found


These don't seem to work with Python3
>> mkvirtualenv census --no-site-packages
>> workon census


Instead try the following (but you'll need virtualenvwrapper later):

> python3 -m venv env

This will create a subfolder called "env"

Exclude your virtual environment directory from your version control system by adding "env" to .gitignore

Then activate

> source env/bin/activate

> pip install -r requirements.txt


The following no longer occured since "python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip" was run first above.
You are using pip version 19.0.3, however version 20.0.2 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
> pip install --upgrade pip



add2virtualenv is part of virtualenvwrapper. 
virtualenvwrapper.sh resides at env/bin


> pip install add2virtualenv

Resulted in:
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement add2virtualenv (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for add2virtualenv


Guessing from the following:https://vicpimakers.ca/links/python-links/setting-up-python-projects-with-virtual-environments/
Added to .bash_profile
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh


> add2virtualenv ./censusreporter

If you want to switch projects or otherwise leave your virtual environment, simply run:

> deactivate


It is preferable to install big packages (like Numpy), or packages you always use (like IPython) globally. All the rest can be installed in a virtual env.
