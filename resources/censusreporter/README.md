# Neighborhood Map  

We're integrating [zipcode maps](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/86000US30318-30318/) with audio-based [social safety net](https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/) assitance.  

### CensusReporter - Django - PostgreSQL

**Project**  
Place Wazimap fork of CensusReporter into a [Python Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) for easier install.  
Place Census Reporter database into [PostgreSQL Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) with files for Docker secrets.


The Wazimap fork provides a Python 3 version of Census Reporter with international usage.  
We're aiming to bring it in sync with the Python 2 version used by [CensusReporter.org](https://CensusReporter.org).  

Start from our [github.com/modelearth/map](https://github.com/modelearth/map) fork of Wazimap Census Reporter.  
Wazimap is maintained by [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/) and in used in Africa and India.  

**Questions**  
How can we improve on the UI and performance of [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov)  
How can demographics data, maps and machine learning be integrated around [social safety net programs](https://www.codeforamerica.org/features/bringing-social-safety-net-benefits-online/)?

**Areas for improvements**  
Zip and county maps  
Fast loading from pre-processed static files  
International contributions  
Sortable tables and lists below maps  

**React Interface**  
Add our [Google Auto Complete Sample](../../../localsite/map/auto/) to the USEEIO-widgets [React Build](../../../io/charts/).  
Expand upon the [EPA's Environmentally-Enabled IO Charts](../../../io/charts/) and integrate with community data portals.  


## Virtual Environment

Venv and Django with Postgres


### Mac Users

[Set up pyenv](https://gist.github.com/wronk/a902185f5f8ed018263d828e1027009b) - includes virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper  
See details under "Let's add Pyenv" after the following.  


Where's my Python running from?

	which python

Initially returned Anaconda (3.7.6) even though pyenv installed:&nbsp; /Users/[username]/opt/anaconda3/bin/python  
After conda update, returned pyenv (3.8.5):&nbsp;  /Users/[username]/.pyenv/shims/python  


	python -V

But it's an older version (3.7.6), which might not be supporting some Flask code, specifcially :=  

Ran the following, which upgraded to python 3.8.5 (even though it said 3.7.7 would be the outcome at start of install)

	conda update --all

<!--
[You may need to make Python3 the default for Mac](virtualenv-troubleshooting.html) - Install a user copy of Python3 using bash, then change your default from Python2 to Python3.   

You may want to use [virtualenv](virtualenv.html) - option for use with Python 2 virtual environment.     
-->

To see the full range of options, run the following command:  

	python -m venv -h

More here: [Venv command (pythonise.com)](https://pythonise.com/categories/python/python-virtual-environments-with-the-venv-command)


### Let's add Pyenv:  

Source for following: [Definitive guide to python on Mac OSX](https://medium.com/@briantorresgil/definitive-guide-to-python-on-mac-osx-65acd8d969d0)  

 **pyenv** for python version management and  
 **poetry** for python package/venv management  


<!-- I'm using xcode, but included this to note the need to change .bash_profile to .zshrc -->

If you chose not to install Xcode, you’ll need to add the SDKROOT environment variable to your shell:

	echo "export SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk" >> ~/.bash_profile

If using zsh, change the end of that last command from ~/.bash_profile to ~/.zshrc .

	echo "export SDKROOT=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX10.14.sdk" >> ~/.zshrc


Install pyenv:

	brew install pyenv

Add pyenv to your shell:

	echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bash_profile

If using zsh, change the end of that last command from ~/.bash_profile to ~/.zshrc

	echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.zshrc

(Optional) You can also <code>brew install pyenv-virtualenv</code> to add virtualenv support to pyenv, but it’s not required since most of the virtualenv work you’ll do with poetry after we install it later. Some people like the pyenv-virtualenv support anyway.  

For the next step, see the [definitive guide](https://medium.com/@briantorresgil/definitive-guide-to-python-on-mac-osx-65acd8d969d0) script for installing Python as a safety net. <!-- skipped because I'd already done this -->  Include python 2.7 <!-- might need this -->

	python -V

See a list of available python versions with pyenv:  

	pyenv install --list

Install a new version

	pyenv install 3.8.5

Pick a version, then set it as the global python version: <!-- was 3.7.6 -->

	pyenv global 3.8.5

### Install poetry

Why you should use poetry:  
Obsoletes virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pipenv, setup.py, requirements.txt, and more.


\~/ translates to your user’s home directory



My .bash_profile contains:

	# aliases
	alias cd..="cd .."
	alias l="ls -al"
	alias lp="ls -p"
	alias h=history

## Wazimap Census Reporter (Setup)


Based on the [Wazimap Setup](https://wazimap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/started.html)  

Install postgres before you enter a virtual environment

	brew install postgres

Optional, if you need postgresql to be launched on login:

	To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
	  brew services start postgresql
	Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
	  pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start

## Using venv

This will install Python 3.7.3 (or latest) and create a subfolder called "env"   
--prompt is optional for showing a name before your terminal prompt.  
If your default is still python 2, then start commands with python3.  

	python -m venv ~/Documents/env1 --prompt MYTEST

Or if your are already in the folder where you're creating your environment...  
(Default directory on a mac is Users/[username].)  

	python -m venv env1

Exclude your virtual environment directory from your version control system by adding "env1" to .gitignore

Then activate. Your commands will then start with (env1):

	source ~/Documents/env1/bin/activate

Command above differs for bash/zsh. Note that \~/Documents/ is not included here:  

See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html  

Upgrade pip to 20.0.2+ since 19.0.3 is system default:

	pip install --upgrade pip

## Django

Installs Django 3.0.3

	pip install django
	django-admin startproject wazimap_ex
	cd wazimap_ex
	rm wazimap_ex/urls.py wazimap_ex/wsgi.py

Install GDAL

	brew install gdal --HEAD

Had one error out of many successful. Appears to have built from mpc-1.1.0.tar.gz source:

You'll need to have PostgreSQL installed first above.  

**Question:** Can we modify so it's not necessary to install PostgreSQL, and only use the API?  

	pip install wazimap

Results with successfully installed Django-2.2.6

See [Step 6](https://wazimap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/started.html) about how to change your settings.py file.

Step 7 - If "createuser -P wazimap" results in error, restart postgresql in another terminal:  

	brew services restart postgresql


<!-- superuser helix p: helix1 -->

You may want to [install DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) SQL Database tools.  

On Mac, first  install the latest version of Java:  

	brew cask install adoptopenjdk --no-quarantine
	brew cask install dbeaver-community

<!--
	If unable to open DBeaver app, try
	brew cask install adoptopenjdk --no-quarantine

	Source:
	https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/homebrew-openjdk/issues/267
-->

DBeaver shortcuts

	Run SQL script: Alt+X
	Run only part of a SQL script: Ctrl+Enter
	You can turn on/off the right panels: F7

	You can generate SQL statements (SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) based on selected rows. To generate SQL, right-click the selected rows, then click Generate SQL and select one of the SQL commands you see.


## django

Trying to get site to appear at: http://localhost:8000/admin
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/

	django-admin startproject mysite
	cd mysite
	python manage.py runserver

Stop dejango site

	Ctrl-C

When you're done with the virtual environment

	deactivate
