## GitHub Actions Data Pipeline

We'll be developing a Python pipeline using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to add support for map layers with 30,000+ records, similar to Hack for LA's [Public Tree Map](https://neighborhood.org/public-tree-map/).  Start by triggering our [FarmFresh Python](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/python/farmfresh) data pull nightly from the [community-data repo pipeline](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/).  

Output [All the Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/) into zip folders in our [zip/io/data repo](https://model.earth/zip/io/)<!-- generated by Kathryn Winglee. -->.  

**Our prior GitHub Actions samples**  
[Scrape city site and save json file using Python](https://github.com/abrie/atl-council-scraper) - Abrie  
[Pull from PDF to a CSV file using R script](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data) - Brant and Abrie  



## Map Projects

Update map.js to include a choropleth map layer with industry density for [show=vehicles](../../localsite/info/#show=vehicles) to represent <a href="mobility/">locations potentially impacted by the transition to EV</a>. See [choropleth map samples](../start/maps/).   

Activate a clickable legend in the map.js file. Place checkboxes before legend items to filter the map points and list below the map.  

Add mockups of integrated interfaces for Department of Labor tools like the [Georgia Labor Market Explorer](https://explorer.gdol.ga.gov/vosnet/Logoff.aspx?Displayonly=1&utype=L&plang=E)  


<!--
Update county [data prep scripts](../../localsite/info/data/) to include zip codes. Get latest from summer intern John Taylor.  
-->

Find a source of "regions within states" based on sets of counties. Apply to [region_select dropdown](../../localsite/info/#state=GA).  

Move items above into our [Beyond Carbon Project Board](https://github.com/localsite/localsite/projects/1). See [Hack for LA](https://github.com/hackforla/website/projects/7) examples.  
<!-- Project created from Automated kanban with reviews template. -->

DONE - Akilah assisted displaying the [Beyond Carbon](../../apps/beyondcarbon/) state results as a table with state names.  

DONE - Kathryn generated state dropdown script from [R-Language script](../../community-data/us/) to include lat/lon attributes for the [brigade map zoom](../../localsite/info/#show=industries&layers=brigades).  

DONE - Kathryn created files for all US zip codes.  She used the [uszipcode programmable database (Python)](https://uszipcode.readthedocs.io/01-Tutorial/index.html) - [Github](https://github.com/MacHu-GWU/uszipcode-project) to generate [a data file for each zip code](https://model.earth/zip/io/#zip=30310). Here's the [processing script](https://github.com/modelearth/zip/tree/master/io).



<!--
DONE - Pull Data to GitHub. Abrie fixed the [Vaccine dosage pull to GitHub](https://github.com/bbrewington/ga.dph.data/pull/1), now we need to [push into a Google Sheet](https://www.google.com/search?q=Github+Actions+send+data+to+Google+Sheet&oq=Github+A[â€¦]et&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64.20842j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).  


Generate static files to drive Data Commons navigation. Crosswalk zipcodes and counties to PUMA regions. This crosswalk resides in DataUSA.io Github repo. 

1. Contribute to our [AWS Amplify React](../aws/amplify/) repo by activating [Last Airbender indicator sets](../../io/charts/inflow-outflow/).  


1. Update EPA's <a href="../../io/charts/">Embeddable IO Widgets</a> generated from [USEEIO API](https://github.com/USEPA/USEEIO_API) local .json data.
