# Getting Started

Steps for creating a static site using Markdown and GitHub Pages with free hosting.  

## 1. Start a local webroot  

Go to the folder where you'd like your webroot to reside and run the following to view pages on localhost:

	python -m http.server 8887

 Or run anywhere and include a path to your webroot. Change /Sites to your custom path:

 	python3 -m http.server 8887 -d /Sites

 Alternatively, you can install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) to view and develop pages offline using https://localhost:8777 on your computer. Web Server for Chrome also allows you to [load a custom domain](https://medium.com/@jmatix/using-chrome-as-a-local-web-server-af04baffd581). Web Server for Chrome does not work as a Brave browser extension on Mac (as of December 2019), but you can add as a Chrome extension, then utilize from within Brave.

## 2. Copy repo(s) to your local computer  

Go to the <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/community'>community</a> repo and click "clone or download"

Choose <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Open in Desktop</a> for an easy way to deploy your changes.  

Clone the repo if you are already a collaborator. Otherwise, fork the repo to submit changes.  


## 3. Place the repos inside your web root folder 

1. Open the folder at [http://localhost:8887/community/](http://localhost:8887/community/)  

2. Project interns: repeat step 2 above for the following repos:  

- <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/io'>io</a> - overview
- <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/eeio'>eeio</a> - charts
- <a href='https://github.com/modelearth/useeio-widgets'>useeio-widgets</a> - NodeJS build
- <a href='https://github.com/georgiadata/smartdata'>smartdata</a> - data

A 404 error will occur for the private smartdata folder if you are not a collaborator.  

## 4. Update markdown pages

Add notes and links in the README.md files which are pulled into index.html pages.  

Industry 
Bioeconomy Planner - BEA
Localization - Places

## 5. Update dataset layouts

Use a Google Sheet or CSV file to [create a list or chart](../dataset), or pull from a JSON file generated by the USEEIO API.

### Mac Users
To avoid commiting your local .DS_Store files to GitHub, you may need to run the following to ignore .DS_Store files during commits forever. The .DS_Store files will continue to set icon sizes in your local file manager.   
 
<!-- Avoid .DS_Store file creation over network connections (article from 2011, confirm this still occurs)
	https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT1629 -->
	git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore  
	echo .DS_Store >> ~/.gitignore

You can toggle seeing hidden files using Command+Shift+Dot. 

### Additional Resources

Examples of editing using markdown language [Markdown to HTML (Dillinger)](https://dillinger.io/)  

[JAM Stack Development](https://jamstack.org) - The process of creating fast sites using static pages with APIs. 

Advanced: Pre-process with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) which delivers static content enfused with React. 

### How to host multiple repos within one site on Github without using subdomains

- Use CloudFlare as proxy with your domain name
- Important: Avoid adding the 4 Google A records (these prevent adding the CNAME record)
- Add a CNAME record in CloudFlare with @ and [github username].github.io
- Create a public repo called [github username].github.io
- Activate GitHub Pages and add your custom domain name.
- Wait a couple minutes for new GitHub Pages site to become available.
- Activate GitHub Pages for each additional repo.
<!-- note, when setting up the prior neighborhood folder was renamed to [github username].github.io -->

### How to update a forked GitHub repo in the browser

On your forked repo: Click Compare > switching the base (if you have not switched already) > Create pull request > Give the pull request a title > Create pull request (again) > Merge pull request (scroll down) > Confirm merge.
