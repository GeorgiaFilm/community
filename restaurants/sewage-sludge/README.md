# Restaurants - Sewage Sludge

We're seeking creative ways to encourage restaurants and grocery stores to stop selling food fertilized with sewage sludge. Let's get everyone to think before they rinse chemicals and medicine down the drain.  

## Biosolid Fertilizer

Sewage Sludge (called biosolid) is an excellent fertilizer for forests, not foods.  

"Sludge contains pharmaceuticals, hormones, pathogens, <!--bacteria, viruses, protozoa and parasitic worms, as well as--> heavy metals like lead, cadmium, arsenic or mercury. It often includes PCBs, PFAS (forever chemicals), dioxins, BPAs and dozens of other harmful substances ranging from flame retardants to hospital waste." [source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/05/biosolids-toxic-chemicals-pollution)

According to the EPA, "About 50% of all biosolids are being recycled to land. These biosolids are used on less than one percent of the nation's agricultural land." [source](https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/frequent-questions-about-biosolids) <!-- 8) What percentage of biosolids are recycled and how many farms use biosolids? -->

## The Good Guys

Kudos to these companies strictly prohibit the application of sewage sludge and biosolids as fertilizers:  Del Monte, H.J. Heinz, Dole, Whole Foods. Switzerland and the Netherlands.

Sewage sludge is not allowed on “certified organic” USDA Certified Organic farms.  


## Shame

The wastewater industry promotes biosolids as “green” and sells it as organic fertilizer in stores like Walmart and Lowe’s.
