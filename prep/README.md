# Prep

[Annual US Census Update, Random Forest notes](https://github.com/StateGov/us/tree/master/all)  

The following folders were originally in the repo root, so path updates may be needed.  

all, crime, regression, summary


## Rules of thumb

Use .gitignore files to avoid adding raw files downloaded for processing.

Add notes with source of files.

Okay to add raw US Census files when steps to download are excessively time consuming.
