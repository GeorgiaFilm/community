#How to Prepare a Winning Entry

##Start early and recruit talent for your team

Encourage team members to register by providing them with the following link:  
[https://model.earth/community/challenge](https://model.earth/community/challenge)  

##Identify a location and explore adverse impacts effecting your area

Use the USEEIO [industry comparison page](https://model.earth/localsite/info/) to identify an issue that relates to your location.  Choose a state then one or more counties to narrow your search.  

Example: When exploring our city's impact, we saw that the airport was a chief offender. We recognized that our neighborhood's local wastewater was processed near the airport, so we decided to investigate converting "Shit to Fuel" to eliminate the dependency on fossile fuels.  We are looking at Austrailia for inspiration since their experimental wasterwater plant also generates graphene to capture additional carbon.

##Recruit local reps who are directly involved with your issue

Create a page within your app folder the prime local movers for your issue. Reach out to them in advance of the event to get addtional insights for your documentation. If you can't contact because it is the weekend of the event, find other links to document the process to make your vision a reality.    

##Select top indicators from the EPA's 20 environmental indicators

Choose environmental impact indicators that match your theme.  

For example, clicking the "Air" button on the industry comparison page returns:  
[set=air&indicators=GHG,GCC,MGHG,OGHG,HRSP,OZON,SMOG,HAPS](../../../localsite/info/#set=air&indicators=GHG,GCC,MGHG,OGHG,HRSP,OZON,SMOG,HAPS)

Paste the values from the URL hash directly into your [Community App](../../../apps/) portal page.  

##Weigh the pros and cons of new innovation for your community

Consider including the positive indicators JOBS and VADD (value-added) to identify which industries contribute the most to prosperity.

##Get started early and attend a meetup if you have any questions.
