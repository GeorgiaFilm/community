Summertime finds most of us drinking more liquids, often from plastic bottles, and driving more as we attend family events or festivals, go on vacations, picnics or leisurely drives, or watch the action at auto races. The waste ultimately resulting from these actions - bald tires and empty bottles - may soon be routinely incorporated into another mode of transportation as railroad ties.<br><br>

Over the last ten years, the U.S Army Corps of Engineers, university researchers and railroad companies have been researching the use of railroad ties made from either recycled rubber tires or plastic lumber made from recycled bottles as replacements for the once-standard pressure treated hardwood ties.<br><br>

The typical wooden tie is treated with hazardous chemicals, often creosote, to resist rotting and insect invasion. This can leach into soil and contaminate the area. Despite treating the wooden ties, these ties still need regular replacing. Most wooden ties last only seven to 15 years before they need to be replaced. The railroad industry estimates they spend over $1 billion each year installing and replacing approximately 14 million railroad ties of the 700 million ties in use around the U.S.<br><br>

In contrast, plastic and rubber railroad ties do not rot or become infected with insects, they are denser than wood, water proof and virtually maintenance free and they are expected to last three to five times longer than wooden ties with a life expectancy of over 50 years. Rubber and plastic ties also deaden train noise. While rubber and plastic tires currently cost more than wooden ties, their durability and many other positive attributes make them cost effective over their lifespan.<br><br>

NP & G Innovations in New York State has developed rubber ties made from recycled vehicle tires. For railroad tie application, about 70 percent of the tire is used, including the steel. Tire sidewalls are not used for railroad ties; however these are ground into crumb rubber and sold for other uses, ensuring that the entire tire is recycled. Rubber ties weigh about 400 pounds each, which is heavier than the average 275 pound wooden tie, but the same equipment used to replace wooden ties can also be used for rubber. The heavier weight of the rubber tie also helps secure the track to the ground more securely.<br><br>

Plastic ties made from bottles weigh quite a bit more, up to 800 pounds each, but each of these ties uses about 1,200 recycled plastic bottles. Plastic lumber can be manufactured to have a wood-grain finish and are UV resistant with the color impregnated throughout the tie. About 10 percent of railroad tracks use concrete ties, which weigh closer to 900 pounds each.<br><br>

Rubber railroad ties made from recycled tires have been tested on a 500 mile section of track in upstate New York for the past three years with excellent success. Despite the extreme weather conditions to which they are exposed and the many tons of moving weight regularly placed on them, the tires have not degraded at all.<br><br>

Some places in the world have already switched to non-wooden railroad ties. Japan uses ties made from virgin foamed polyurethane with glass reinforcement and San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit has also switched to non-wooden ties. The European market is also expected to switch to rubber or plastic ties in the near future.<br><br>

One additional benefit of using recycled materials to make durable railroad ties is that tires, plastic bottles and railroad tracks are found throughout the country. Since these ties are heavy to transport, it may make more sense to site facilities throughout the nation near tire or plastic recycling facilities, thus providing jobs for American workers in numerous locations. Making a superior product using recycled feedstock at numerous regional facilities - what a win-win situation.<br><br>

<a href="http://hansentie.com/">Hansen All-Rubber Railroad Ties</a><br>
All-Rubber ties capture carbon and reduce sound and vibrations, unlike cement ties which release carbon from limestone during production. All-rubber ties are also safer than carcinogenic creosote-coated ties which remain in wide spread use in the railroad industry, despite being banned for consumer&nbsp;use. 

"Without an economic method of re-use or disposal, 80% of these tires end up in landfills. The Hansen rubber railroad tie recycles these tires and utilizes 68,000 tires (car tire equivalents) per mile or 21 tires per railroad tie. All-rubber railroad ties are 100% recyclable into new rubber railroad ties or other crumb rubber products."<br><br>
