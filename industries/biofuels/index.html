    "The U.S. government is supporting efforts to produce ethanol with methods that use less energy than conventional fermentation and that use cellulosic biomass, which requires less cultivation, fertilizer, and pesticides than corn or sugar cane. Cellulosic ethanol feedstock includes native prairie grasses, fast-growing trees, sawdust, and even waste paper."

    "The plants in Franklin and Madison counties burn a combination of discarded industrial wood and creosote-coated railroad ties. Burning railroad ties in authorized steam boilers was approved in 2016 when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href="https://www.epa.gov/rcra/frequent-questions-about-final-rule-additions-list-categorical-non-waste-fuels-other-treated" target="treated_rules">revised its rules</a>."
