# Community Sustainability Tools with US EPA and the Georgia Department of Economic Development
Work with the USEPA, the GA Dept of Economic Development, and GA communities on an exciting [project](https://www.epa.gov/research/regional-sustainability-and-environmental-sciences-research-program-reses)
(see 'Community-driven Application Development Using USEEIO Models') to build tools to support open-source community
 web applications that use an EPA life cycle model of the economy (USEEIO) along with Georgia community data
  to assess community sustainability and economic development.

## Research Mentors:
Dr. Wesley Ingwersen, US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development

Mr. Loren Heyns, Georgia Department of Economic Development

## Georgia Tech Research Partner:
TBD

# Community Material Flow Tracking and Analysis

## Description
The candidate will develop Python code to translate community and industry material flow data,
 -- including on generation, transfer, recycling/reprocessing, and reuse -- to relate them to EPA's USEEIO model.   

The work will require close technical collaboration with the research mentors, the USEEIO modeling team
 and other interns.

The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in the Sept 19-20 community application
 development event @GA Tech to leverage this tool to serve community applications.

The candidate will be exposed to the latest in sustainable materials management modeling, make contacts at
federal, state agencies, GA Tech, in industry, and become part of a modeling team.

## Learning Goals
Learn essentials of environmentally-extended input-output modeling

Learn about material life cycles

## Top Desired Skills
Python with data science and API libraries (pandas, requests)

Github

Team code development in a git-environment

Strong interest in sustainability and economic development

## Deliverables
Python code and documentation to capture community material generation, transfer, recycling and reuse data and link it to USEEIO


# New Technology Scenario Analysis

## Description
Communities are interested in evaluating the costs and benefits of new technologies and investments on their sustainability.
To evaluate this with the EPA's USEEIO model, the new technologies need to be modeled as a change in the monetary production
recipe (the purchases made by an industry) as well as in their direct resource use and emissions. The candidate will help
translate new technologies models into this format using the useeior modeling framework to enable scenario analysis.

The work will require close technical collaboration with the research mentors, the USEEIO modeling team and other interns.

The candidate will be expected to play a leading role in the Sept 19-20 community application development event @GA Tech.

The candidate will be exposed to the latest in sustainable materials management modeling, make contacts at
federal, state agencies, GA Tech, in industry, and become part of a modeling team.

## Learning Goals
Learn essentials of environmentally-extended input-output modeling
Learn USEPA's useeior modeling framework

## Top Desired Skills
R language

Github

Team code development in a git-environment

Strong interest in sustainability and economic development

## Deliverables
R code and documentation to model new technologies in USEEIO
