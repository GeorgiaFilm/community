We’re partnering with Georgia communities to create online tools to evaluate how technological changes in local industries, utilities and logistics can reduce carbon footprints and protect the environ-ment while creating jobs and new business opportunities.

<h2>Community Input-Output Modeling</h2>

<p>
The US Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model (USEEIO) is a national life cycle model that combines environmental and economic data to characterize both positive and negative effects associated with the production and consumption of goods and services in the United States. It tracks close to 400 commodities and over 2000 resources, emissions, and waste types to characterize 20+ environmental and economic indicators. USEEIO is widely used by corporations, including Amazon, nonprofits, government and academia for applications such as carbon footprinting and sector-based environmental assessment.​
</p>

<p>
The EPA, GA Department of Economic Development, and Georgia Tech are working with Georgia communities interested in using the model to evaluate economic and environmental outcomes through web applications that specifically address community concerns by combing a Georgia version of the USEEIO model with local data to add detail to the evaluation.​
</p>

<p>
Using the Georgia version of the USEEIO model, teams will investigate linkages between material data and the regionalized IO model using information gathered on: (1) industries or final uses that are generating the materials, (2) how the materials currently are used, disposed or handled, (3) possible uses of the material to substitute for current industry material or energy requirements, (4) other technological and environmental changes related to material use and substitution, and (5) the market consequences of scaling up material cycling changes.​
</p>

<p>
The resulting regional material flow analysis will include characterization of local material streams in both quantity and quality using data from local stakeholders. The regional focus provides an opportunity to add detail to the national model for the unique needs of local project planning and economic development.
