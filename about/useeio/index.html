<h1 class="h1-home">About USEEIO</h1>

<div class="rightside">
We’re partnering with Georgia communities to create online tools to evaluate how technological changes in local industries, utilities and logistics can reduce carbon footprints and protect the environment while creating jobs and new business opportunities.
</div>


<h2 style="overflow:auto">The U.S.'s Environmentally Extended IO Model</h2>

<p>
The US Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model (USEEIO) is a national life cycle model that combines environmental and economic data to characterize both positive and negative effects associated with the production and consumption of goods and services in the United States. It tracks close to 400 commodities and over 2000 resources, emissions, and waste types to characterize 20+ environmental and economic indicators. USEEIO is widely used by corporations, including Amazon, nonprofits, government and academia for applications such as carbon footprinting and sector-based environmental assessment.​
</p>

<p>
The EPA, GA Department of Economic Development, and Georgia Tech are working with Georgia communities interested in using the model to evaluate economic and environmental outcomes through web applications that specifically address community concerns by combing a Georgia version of the USEEIO model with local data to add detail to the evaluation.​
</p>

<p>
Using the Georgia version of the USEEIO model, teams will investigate linkages between material data and the regionalized IO model using information gathered on: (1) industries or final uses that are generating the materials, (2) how the materials currently are used, disposed or handled, (3) possible uses of the material to substitute for current industry material or energy requirements, (4) other technological and environmental changes related to material use and substitution, and (5) the market consequences of scaling up material cycling changes.​
</p>

<p>
The resulting regional material flow analysis will include characterization of local material streams in both quantity and quality using data from local stakeholders. The regional focus provides an opportunity to add detail to the national model for the unique needs of local project planning and economic development.

        <h2>The <b>USEEIO</b> Model</h2>
        - The US Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model (USEEIO).<BR>
        - An economic-environmental model of the full economy: ~400 industries and commodities<BR>
        - Developed and maintained by EPA and partners<BR>
        - A Georgia version was developed with GA partners and is being updated<BR>
        - Now widely in industry, the non-profit sector, in government and academia<BR>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Participation Requirements for GA Communities</h2>
        - We want to select 1-2 GA communities to apply this model to meet local interests<BR>
        - Communities must be interested in economic development and sustainability<BR>
        - Communities will provide data and agree on information needs to be met<BR>
        - Communities work with project intern<BR>
        - Communities must express a desire in using the tool to inform decision making<BR>
