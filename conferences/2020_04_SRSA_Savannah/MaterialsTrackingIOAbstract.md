## Abstract

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed and continues to enhance
the US Environmentally Extended Input-Output Model (USEEIO). USEEIO is a national life cycle
model that combines economic and environmental data to characterize environmental and economic effects associated
with the production and consumption of goods and services in the United States.
It tracks ~400 commodities and >2000 resources, emissions, and waste types to characterize 20+ environmental and economic indicators.
USEEIO is widely used in industry, the non-profit sector, in government and academia for applications such as footprinting
and sector-based environmental assessment. EPA is also developing regionalized versions of USEEIO
as a two region state-of-interest and rest-of-US form, and has developed a preliminary model
for the state of Georgia.

The EPA, GA Department of Economic Development, and Georgia Tech are now working with interested Georgia communities
on using the model to evaluate the potential economic and environment consequences of new development directions
through the creation of web applications that specifically address community concerns using the USEEIO model
along with local data in the background to support the evaluation.

One strong interest in a Georgia community is related to innovative recovery or alternative use of
available materials. This interest aligns well that of the EPA's Sustainable Materials Management program,
which currently uses USEEIO alongside other data sources related to waste material generation and management.
This project team will be working with stakeholders in a public-private partnership of 6 Southeast Georgia counties
to collect material generation data and new technological improvements involving increased
material efficiency to evaluate the consequences using the GA version of USEEIO.

The proposed method for consideration involves the linkages of these material data with the regionalized IO model,
which requires knowledge of:
1. what industries or final uses are generating the materials,
2. how are the materials currently used, disposed or handled,
3. what are possible uses of the material to substitute for current industry material requirements,
4. what are other technological and environmental changes related to material use and substitution
5. what are the market consequences of scaling up material cycling changes

The method also requires a sufficient characterization of the material streams in quality and quality,
for which national standards are still lacking.
