Draft session title and abstract

## Environmental Accounting Applications and Methods in the United States

Over the last decade, several publicly available multi-regional environmentally extended input-output (EEIO) databases
have been developed, particularly in Europe and Australia, and widely used in environmental input-output
and life-cycle analysis (LCA) worldwide. Whereas the development and use of EEIOs has been less prevalent in
the United States, there is a similar need and desire, in some cases even regulatory requirement, for more
comprehensive environmental impact assessments. This has recently led to the development of a series of publicly
available EEIO datasets for the country.

This session has two main objectives: (1) to explore the current state of development, challenges, and applications
of EEIO models in the United States, including data availability, regionalization, modeling, integration with LCA
and future developments; and (2) to induce a dialogue between input-output and life-cycle analysis experts.
