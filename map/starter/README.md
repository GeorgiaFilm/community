<h2 style="margin-top:0px">Map of Fresh Produce</h2>

We're creating an embeddable map widget for CSV data hosted on GitHub and Google Sheets to allow suppliers to promote when they are open for curbside pickup and&nbsp;delivery. We'll be tapping existing processes for sharing hours of operation, including [All&nbsp;The&nbsp;Places](https://www.alltheplaces.xyz/).
