# Create Your Page

Here are steps for creating a static site using Markdown and GitHub Pages with free hosting.  

Step 1: Install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) to view and develop pages offline using localhost on your computer. (Note the folder indicated as your local site root.)

Step 2: Clone the "<a href='https://github.com/statedata/community'>statedata/community</a>" repo to your local computer.  (Fork if you plan to collaborate on updates.)

Step 3: When cloning the repo, place the "community" folder inside the folder where "Web Server for Chrome" points.  

Step 4: Open the folder at [http://localhost:8887/community/](http://localhost:8887/community/)  

Step 4: Edit the main README.md page to customize your intro.
