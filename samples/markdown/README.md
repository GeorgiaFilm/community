# Create a page

Steps for creating a static site using Markdown and GitHub Pages with free hosting.  

1. Install [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) to view and develop pages offline using localhost on your computer. (Note the folder indicated as your local site root.)

2. Clone the "<a href='https://github.com/statedata/community'>statedata/community</a>" repo to your local computer.  (Fork if you plan to collaborate on updates.)

3. When cloning the repo, place the "community" folder inside the folder where "Web Server for Chrome" points.  

4. Open the folder at [http://localhost:8887/community/](http://localhost:8887/community/)  

5. Edit the main README.md page to customize your intro.
